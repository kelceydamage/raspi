# Development

Scripts can be modified, but the default location to install raspi is:
```
(raspi) nvidia@tegra-ubuntu:/opt/git/raspi
```

There is an expectation to be using the `raspi` virtual environment. Examples will take this into account.

```bash
pip install pytest-cov
pip install python-coveralls
```
